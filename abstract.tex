\begin{abstract}
The faculty at the Hartford Evans Langley Polytechnic University System
(HELPUS) require a program for managing and grading RA contracts.  This
document describes how we will design the RA contract program, the risks to
the security policy of this program, the mitigations we will use to mitigate
these risks, and a plan for demonstrating that the design and implementation
meet the HELPUS security requirements.
